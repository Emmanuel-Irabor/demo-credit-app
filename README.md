# demo-credit-app


## Overview and Project Summary
In the fintech space today, many of lenders use mobile apps to reach millions of customers. At this scale, we can use NodeJS with TypeScript as its backend software development stack which allows us to rapidly ideate and release features and functionality.

Demo Credit is a mobile lending app that requires wallet functionality. This is needed as borrowers need a wallet to receive the loans they have been granted and also send the money for repayments.

You are required to build an MPV wallet service where:

A user can create an account
A user can fund their account
A user can transfer funds to another userâ€™s account
A user can withdraw funds from their account.


## Objective
- The goal of this project is to provide a secure platform for users to make financial transactions including funding their account, sending and recieving funds.

## Requirements

#### Project Requirements
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads) MySQL is a relational database management system based on the Structured Query Language, which is the popular language for accessing and managing the records in the database. It is the most popular Open Source SQL database management system, is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation. Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing organizations including Facebook, Twitter, Booking.com, and Verizon rely on MySQL to save time and money powering their high-volume Web sites, business-critical systems and packaged software.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) is an API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. This is done by allowing users to create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses. The result - more efficient and less tedious work.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
